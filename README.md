All drivers were installed successfully 
Goldhen was placed on root of USB (afterwards I copied it to payloads folder, USB 1tb HDD, and the root of the ps4 #just to be safe lol)
Each was run using "run as admin" and stage2's were all 11.0, AND 
PPPwn - PPPwn_v1.2_win64 - Ran stage1.bin in PPPwn loader and fails at "Waiting for PPPoe" and IP fails on PS4.
      - PPPwn_v1.3_win64 - This is the download that started offering a stage 2 (could be wrong tho lol) Fails at same                            spot as 1.2. 
      - PPPwn_v1.4_win64 - Ran stage2.bin and fails like the 1.3.
      - PPPwn_v1.5_win64 - Ran stage2.bin and success on the 4th manual retry.
At one point with PPPWN 1.3 I started running stage2.bin from previous 1.2 and 1.1 because there was updates to the PPWN loader. This is where I started having success on the jailbreak. I continued this with each update release. 1.3 ran 1.2's 11.0 stage2.bin. 1.4 ran 1.3's and 1.2's stage2.bin. 
There was also a goldhen payload that I was able to load into 1.3 when i told me to pick a stage2.bin, i just ran the goldhen.bin and it did what a successful stage2.bin did for me. 
I have also left the goldhen bin on my usb permantly. PPPwn loader 1.4 with the 11.0 stage2.bin from 1.3's files has been 1 try success everytime.

My system crashes is I mess around with with webkit payloads for either too long or to many to fast. Webkit Todex payload freezes my console within 30 mins. 
I see quite a bit of game crashes, like NFS underground 2 plays for while but crashes sometimes when saving to MemCard.
ps4tool lets me look at its setting but any other contoller click and it crashes.
I havent had any issues coming out of rest mode once someone said to disable certain setting. 

Currently running PPPwn 1.4 with the 11.0 stage2.bin from 1.3's 11.0. I dont know if the payloads are different but for whatever the reason, this is my case hahahahahahahahaha.

This was done with atleast 10 to 15 tries each fail till 1.4 using 1.3's\\11.0\\stage2.bin. I dont have much, if any experience in computers etc.. compared to the lowest of devs. Enough to get me by i guess.. Hope this info helps in anyway.
